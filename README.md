# Magical-Sudoku

This sudoku solver project usage Backtracking approach. A 9X9 sudoku can generate 6.671×10^21 combinations. Which can’t be solved using typical machines. But by backtracking we can solve it instantly. But here I used “pruning” which is inspired from a machine learning concept by which using this concept it solves this sudoku instantly.
This project was made using the JavaFX framework.

Here is the Demonstration video made by me: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o_M1BDSzE9tWShJh40SPmW8evGUgKsn5/view
